# Sozu
Open Source for Sozu: Self-Powered Radio Tags for Building-Scale Activity Sensing (to appear at [UIST 2019](http://uist.acm.org/uist2019/))

## About

Sozu a low-cost sensing system that can detect a wide range of events wirelessly, through walls and without line of sight, at whole-building scale. Instead of using batteries, Sozu tags convert energy from activities that they sense into RF broadcasts, acting like miniature self-powered radio stations.

### Sozu Toolkit
we created a toolkit that consists of a Sozu tag connected to a solar cell, an RTL-SDR, a set of antennas, and demo code. We also wrote a quick [start guide](https://github.com/FIGLAB/Sozu/tree/master/toolkit) on how to set up the software, deploy Sozu tags, and receive signals:
